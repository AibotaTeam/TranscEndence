# TranscEndence
An addon built as an entry to slimefun's addonjam-2020, aiming at showing some love to the barren voidy dimension full of tall dudes who hate standing in one place for too long.

## Contents
The idea revolves around collecting particles from the Void via a specific machine. Mixing and matching you can then go on to create various new items, ending up with a new energy source along the way too! The end objective is a set of items which, when activated, give a permanent potion effect (up until death).
